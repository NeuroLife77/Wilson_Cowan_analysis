# Wilson_Cowan_analysis

Contains derivations for the jacobian, nullclines, and some functions necessary to implement fixed point(s) localization using the newton method.

Will also contain interactive plots of the phase space and bifurcation analyses eventually.

Might also include some attempts at finding a latent space for the various qualitative behaviors of the system using neural network training on the parameter-to-dynamics mapping (if I remember to put it here when I get there).
